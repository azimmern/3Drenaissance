## Course Description

This course examines the making of scientific glass instruments such as optical lenses and alchemical glasses in the early modern period (1350-1750), in order to reflect upon key historical and philosophical issues, including the rise of experimentation; the cultural, technical, and epistemic value of glass; and questions of methodology and evidence in the reconstruction of historical objects and experiences. As they attempt to design and closely mimic material artefacts from the renaissance, students will also take into critical consideration the rise of 3D printing and its significance for contemporary science. The course will be run as a seminar, with discussions of primary and secondary materials, as well as a laboratory, with hands-on work and training. 





### Course Organization

Our class meetings will begin as a mixture of lecture and seminar-style discussion in the Rare Books and Special Collections of the Hesburgh Library, with a focus on. In workshops, students will begin with tutorials on TinkerCAD and slicing software (Cura) and begin small jobs for 3D printers, growing their familiarity with their own tools and technologies as they learn about the circumstances and techniques of artisans and craftsmen of the early modern period. 

### Note on Technology
For a lecture-style class like ours, compelling research suggests that taking notes on laptops inhibits your learning by encouraging you to transcribe what you hear verbatim rather than listen, digest, engage, and participate actively. I recommend [this article on laptops in lecture classes](https://www.brookings.edu/research/for-better-learning-in-college-lectures-lay-down-the-laptop-and-pick-up-a-pen/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=es) and encourage you to reflect on its findings as you decide how and what kinds of notes you wish to take.<br>

### Accommodations
Any student with University-approved accommodations should speak with me within the first ten days of class to discuss their individual situation. <br>

### Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship

This course focuses heavily on some paid tools that exist in Adobe Creative Suite. If you are located in Norman, you can access all of these programs for free in the Gaylord Computer labs. Your initial login uses your OU NetID (4x4) as your user name, and “changeme” as your password.  You will be prompted to change your password on your first logon Their Gaylord College network login is distinct from your OU Ozone/email login and only applies to the Gaylord College network. You may not share their login information with anyone.  Doing so may result in their losing access to the network. Please log off when finished using a workstation, but never shut down the computers. Please be courteous of the other students who use these spaces by keeping lids on drinks and by being careful with food. Trash and recycling bins are available in all labs and throughout the College.

### Special Needs

Students who need special accommodations or have special needs are invited to share these concerns or requests as soon as possible.  Requests for reasonable accommodation should be addressed to the Sarah Bea Accessibility Resources
