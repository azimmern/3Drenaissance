## Course Description

This course examines the making of scientific glass instruments such as optical lenses and alchemical glasses in the early modern period (1350-1750), in order to reflect upon key historical and philosophical issues, including the rise of experimentation; the cultural, technical, and epistemic value of glass; and questions of methodology and evidence in the reconstruction of historical objects and experiences. As they attempt to design and closely mimic material artefacts from the renaissance, students will also take into critical consideration the rise of 3D printing and its significance for contemporary science. The course will be run as a seminar, with discussions of primary and secondary materials, as well as a laboratory, with hands-on work and training. 





### Course Organization

Our class meetings begin as a mixture of lecture and seminar-style discussion in the Rare Books and Special Collections of the Hesburgh Library. In lab-style workshops, students then complete tutorials on CAD and slicing software (TinkerCAD and Cura) to begin small jobs for 3D printers. As they grow in familiarity with  cutting-edge tools and digital technologies of their own time, they learn about and inquire into the techniques of artisans and craftsmen of the early modern period. 

### Note on Technology
For a lecture-style class like ours, compelling research suggests that taking notes on laptops inhibits your learning by encouraging you to transcribe what you hear verbatim rather than listen, digest, engage, and participate actively. I recommend [this article on laptops in lecture classes](https://www.brookings.edu/research/for-better-learning-in-college-lectures-lay-down-the-laptop-and-pick-up-a-pen/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=es) and encourage you to reflect on its findings as you decide how and what kinds of notes you wish to take.<br>

### Accommodations
Any student with University-approved accommodations should speak with the faculty within the first ten days of class to discuss their individual situation. <br>
