# Class information for teachers

This material under this GitHub organization is for a 5 session, 8 Week summer course on PR Publications.  It consists of:

* [A repository for the syllabus](README.md)
* [Aggregation of Student Blogs]()

## Materials

All class materials and assignments are in public repositories under a single organization, which has the added benefits of:

* Keeps everything easy to find
* Giving students experience with:
    * Interacting and contributing to open source
* Making it easy for others to watch changes, fork, create issues and pull requests against the class materials

## Structure

The structure of the class relies heavily on Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop and InDesign), [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com) video tutorials, and course blogs.

Basically the only thing that isn't done on the open web s giving the grades, which are done through [Desire2Learn](http://learn.ou.edu).

Students get both content and activities through this repository site and will work on them on a number of tools including Photoshop, InDesign, [Canva](http://canva.com), [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com), etc. Students can blog on a number of platforms including [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com), [Blogger](http://blogger.com), and [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) or they can self host Wordpress on the OU's web platform [OU Create](http://create.ou.edu)

## Engagement

Because the students blog all of their work which is syndicated to a hub, students have the ability to see each others work as well as comment on it. I encourage students to do this rather than working in individual silos. Because this class is rooted in creativity, part of their learning will come from seeing how other perspective's interpret the assignments.

## Sharing

The material is free to modify and distribute â€“ if you end up using some of all of the material for your own class, training materials, etc., I would love to [hear from you](https://github.com/prpubs/summer16/issues)!

## Thanks

The main layout for this site has been forked from another course on Github called [Advanced JS](https://github.com/advanced-js/). A million thanks to them for creating such a simple layout for me to use.
